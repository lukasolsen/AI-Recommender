AI-Recommender is a simple but powerful tool for creating a recommender system from scratch using Python. We have used the power of machine learning to create a system that can recommend books to users based on their reading history. The system uses cosine similarity to compare the text data of the books and provide the most similar ones as recommendations. We have also implemented a simple GUI using the CustomTkinter module, making it easy for users to interact with the system.
